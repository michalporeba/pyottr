# Python package for OTTR

Antlr definition in `stottr.g4` from 

https://www.antlr.org/

## Notes

* To build the grammar lexers and parsers do `make grammar`.
* To make it work add `turtleDoc : directive*;` as a first rule in `Turtle.g4`.
* To learn about ANTLR, see [the mega tutorial](https://tomassetti.me/antlr-mega-tutorial) by Gabriele Tomassetti.
